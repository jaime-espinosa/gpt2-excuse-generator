    "> In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-2 Wrote**\n",
    ">The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns.\n",
    "\n",
    ">While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez stated, “We can see, for example, that they have a common ‘language,’ something like a dialect or dialectic.”\n",
    "\n",
    ">Dr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America.\n",
    "\n",
    ">While their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to Pérez, “In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common.”\n",
    "\n",
    ">However, Pérez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. “But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in social organization,” said the scientist."

    "I was so excited to get the XL model working, and fully expected the excuses the XL model generated to be far and above better than the excuses generated by the small model.  I was surprised to discover that the output of the XL model was both better **and** worse than the small model.  The XL excuses were significantly better in terms of sounding like real excuses a human would invent, but significantly worse in terms of being hilarious.  Specifically, they were less hilarious, because they sounded so mundane and legitimately plausible.  For example:\n",
    "* I hit a major roadblock when had problems with the oven controls. I thought I was turning on the oven, but only turned on the light.  When I pulled the food out of the oven it was still frozen.But the real problem to focus on here is  that the recipe is basically unreadable, at least to me.\n",
    "* I couldn't do that because I had to take care of the garden.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The large model clearly knows more about food, and the way the world works:\n",
    "* Where I ran into a roadblock was that my leftover beef sausage was not fat free.I hope you're not too disappointed and  don't make me do this again.\n",
    "* What stopped me dead was that I realized that liquorice extract was necessary for the recipe.On the bright side,  I was able to find a recipe for a nice chocolate chip ice cream that was tasty and healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large model also settles for more straightforward and boring excuses more easily.  If the definition of \"better\" text generation involves being funny, I think the small model can actually do better sometimes, because it has less knowledge to work with and has to lean on creativity more than the experience and statistics of the large model.  It could be similar to how drunk people say more fun things sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The small model is more like a wild teenager, and the XL model is more like a more sedate, restrained adult with more life experience. But the XL model still has the *crazy* in there.  It came up with this:\n",
